 Creates a directory with given attributes at the specified path.

 @param path A path string identifying the directory to create. You may specify a full path or a path that is relative to the current working directory. This parameter must not be nil.
 @param createIntermediates If YES, this method creates any non-existent parent directories as part of creating the directory in path. If NO, this method fails if any of the intermediate parent directories does not exist. This method also fails if any of the intermediate path elements corresponds to a file and not a directory.
 @param attributes The file attributes for the new directory and any newly created intermediate directories. You can set the owner and group numbers, file permissions, and modification date. If you specify nil for this parameter or omit a particular value, one or more default values are used as described in the discussion. For a list of keys you can include in this dictionary, see Constants section lists the global constants used as keys in the attributes dictionary. Some of the keys, such as NSFileHFSCreatorCode and NSFileHFSTypeCode, do not apply to directories.
 @param error On input, a pointer to an error object. If an error occurs, this pointer is set to an actual error object containing the error information. You may specify nil for this parameter if you do not want the error information.
 @return YES if the directory was created, YES if createIntermediates is set and the directory already exists), or NO if an error occurred.
